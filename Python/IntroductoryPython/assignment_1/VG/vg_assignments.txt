8. Change
    - Input all the variables as floats.
    - I calculate the change you should recieve.
    - Using integer-division I compute the amount of 1000 bills you should recieve,
    and using modular division I compute the remaining change.
    - I repeat this process for all bills and coins, going down in bill/coin value.
    - And lastly I print the results.

14. Tax
    - Input the salary
    - Firstly check if the salary is positive
    - Next check the value of the salary
    - Depending on the value, compute the tax differently
    - Round the tax to nearest correct integer
    - Print the results

15. Squarecolor
    - input the square as letter and number (e.g. a1, g4, k9)
    - split the input into two variables, one for the letter and one for the number
    - check if the letter is acceptable (a-h); if not then square is outside the board (not good)
    - depending on if the number is even or odd it fits into different lists with 
    acceptable values (1-8); if outside then square is outside the board (not good)
    - Depending on the letter and number the result is either white or black
    - Lastly print the results
